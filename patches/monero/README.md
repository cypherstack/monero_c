# 0001-polyseed

Polyseed support for wallets [planned in long distant future as a part of walet3 - not getting upstream, no PR available].

Note, only English support is available due to issues with normalization libraries.

> tobtoht: You may also want to reconsider supporting languages other than English: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki#wordlists (this is about BIP39, but because unicode normalization is such a PITA it will become true for Polyseed wallets as well)

Considering the fact that even Feather Wallet doesn't support non-english seeds, it makes sense to go that way.

At least until (if ever) feather wallet supports multi-language polyseed seeds I don't think it is a good idea to support them, especially because of possible issues when targetting different platforms.
